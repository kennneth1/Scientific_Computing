Python programs with applications of physics

These programs solve problems that we encounter in real world physics applications. Applications include problems in differential equations, partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, problems of general mathematical
physics, like computing integrals, statistical problems with random number generators and data analysis (this includes statistical analysis).
